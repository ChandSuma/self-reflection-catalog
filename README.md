# Self-Reflection Question Catalog
This catalog contains questions for self reflection

## Questions to start:

- What are my core values? What are the beliefs, guiding principles or ideas that are deeply important to me? What are my priorities?
- What are my unique gifts, skills, strengths or talents?
* What are the weaknesses or blind spots I need to watch out for?
* Who do I want to be?
What energy do I want to bring to everything I do?
What is the impact or difference I want to make? How do I want to serve, contribute or add value?
What are my passions? What do I love? What gets me engaged, motivated and excited?
Are there any beliefs that I have that are limiting me?
What do I want for my life? (after all, if you donâ€™t know what you want, how do you expect to get there?)
When am I at my best?
