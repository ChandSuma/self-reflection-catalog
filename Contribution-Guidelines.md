## One Question, one Category
Each category represents a topic related to self-improvement. Many questions could be assigned to more than one category. But in this list, we want to avoid many duplications.

## Question Format
Please, use the following format for your question(s) in Pull Requests: "Your Question" â€” Category. 

## Review Workflow
We will do our best to review your submission as soon as we can. 
Please consider that we study full-time and have a part-time job. :D 
Your contribution might be rejected if the question didn't pass our curation. Of course, this is very subjective and if you think we are being unfair, [do let us know](https://twitter.com/yournally).
